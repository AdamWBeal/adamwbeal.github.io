### The Data
This week's data science project was to import a provided dataset and figure out how to make it usable.  The dataset contained all the songs from the Billboard Hot 100 in the year 2000.  The variables included track name, artist, length of song, the dates of when the song entered the list and peaked as well as its position on the list throughout its run


I wanted to know about the similarity between the chart trajectories of songs and if they could be generalized, so I made this plot which shows



Curious about the distinct shape of the plot, I decided to do a little bit of research on Billboard.  The endlessly reliable source known as Wikipedia contained the following paragraph:

>Billboard, in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks, has (since 1991) removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart. Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently (as of 2015), a song is permanently moved to "recurrent status" if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position number 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks.[8] Exceptions are made to re-releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success. These rare cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and ultimately determined by Billboard's chart managers and staff.
